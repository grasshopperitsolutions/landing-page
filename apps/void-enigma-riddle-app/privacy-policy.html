      <h1>Void Enigma – Privacy Policy</h1>
      <div class="pp-updated">Last updated: 06 December 2025</div>

      <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
      <p>
        This privacy policy explains how <em>Void Enigma</em> (the “App”)
        handles information. The App is provided by
        <strong>[Your Name or Company]</strong>, located in
        <strong>[Your Country]</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any questions, you can contact us at
        <strong>[your-contact-email]</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>2. What data the app collects</h2>
      <p>
        The App is designed as a simple riddle generator and does
        <strong>not</strong> require you to create an account, log in, or
        provide any personal details such as your name, email address, phone
        number, or location.
      </p>
      <p>The App:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Does <strong>not</strong> collect or store your contacts, photos,
          messages, precise location, or payment information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Does <strong>not</strong> include in-app advertising SDKs or
          third-party tracking libraries in its current version.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you later add analytics, crash reporting, or ads, you must update
        this policy to describe exactly what is collected and why.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Use of the Gemini API</h2>
      <p>
        When you request a new riddle, the App sends a text prompt to the
        <strong>Google Gemini API</strong> to generate a riddle and answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The content sent is limited to generic instructions (for example, asking
        for a short, fun riddle) and does not include personal identifiers about
        you. The AI response (riddle and answer) is displayed on your device and
        may be temporarily stored in the App’s memory to avoid showing the same
        riddle repeatedly in the same session.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more information about how Google handles data, please review the
        Gemini API and related privacy documentation provided by Google.
      </p>

      <h2>4. How we use and store data</h2>
      <p>Within the App, we may temporarily store:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The current riddle and answer.</li>
        <li>
          A short in-memory list of previously shown riddles in this session, to
          reduce repetition.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This data stays on your device’s memory while the App is running and is
        cleared when you reset the history or close the App. We do not create
        long-term user profiles from this information.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not use this data for marketing, profiling, or tracking across
        apps or devices.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Third-party services</h2>
      <p>
        Besides the Google Gemini API used to generate riddle text, the App does
        not integrate other third-party services such as analytics, advertising
        networks, or social plugins in its current version.
      </p>
      <p>
        If additional third-party services are added in future updates, this
        policy will be updated to describe what data those services receive and
        for what purpose.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The App is intended for a general audience and generates riddles that
        are meant to be suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect
        personal information from children.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you believe a child has provided personal information through the
        App, please contact us so we can delete it.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Data security</h2>
      <p>
        Because the App does not create user accounts or store personal data on
        our own servers, security risks are limited.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data transmitted to the Gemini API uses HTTPS, which helps protect it in
        transit; however, no method of transmission or storage is completely
        secure.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Your choices and rights</h2>
      <p>
        Since the App does not collect or store your personally identifiable
        information on our servers, there is typically no profile for you to
        access, correct, or delete.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you contact us about privacy or data questions, we will do our best
        to respond and explain how the App works and what data it touches.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Changes to this privacy policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this privacy policy from time to time, for example when we
        add features like analytics, accounts, or advertising.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we make changes, we will update the “Last updated” date above and,
        where appropriate, notify you in the App or on the app store listing.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Contact us</h2>
